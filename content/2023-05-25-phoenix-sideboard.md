{% prematter %}

My dear girlfriend Alyssa[ref]she can be found online in many places including her [blog] and [twitter][/ref] is indulging me by trying out tournament magic. She wanted to play something reasonably competitive & not have to spend a ton & to not have to make cuts to save on budget & for there to be a local scene. She picked pioneer.

I don't play pioneer. I am okay at magic[ref]I am an experienced amateur. I made mythic in each season I was active: 2019 [March][2019 March], [May][2019 May], [June][2019 June], [July][2019 July], [October][2019 October], [December][2019 December]. And 2023 [January][2023 January] and [May][2023 May] (pending). I also have an okay finish in a [minor legacy tournament][/ref]:

and so I think maybe I can be helpful despite this. I made this [overview] of the format to help her pick a deck. She's built UR Phoenix and is taking it to an event soon. I now attempt to help her sideboard. Read on for wild, uninformed speculation about UR Phoenix and the pioneer format in general.

## The Gist

You are a Xerox™ deck: you want to cast cheap spells, especially self-replacing ones ("cantrips") to set up wins through {% unicard {static}/media/phoenix-sideboard/grn-91-arclight-phoenix.jpg Arclight Phoenix %} reanimations and {% unicard {static}/media/phoenix-sideboard/soi-92-awoken-horror.jpg Awoken Horror %} beats.

You expect to spend the first few turns "setting up": using the cantrips to get {% unicard {static}/media/phoenix-sideboard/grn-91-arclight-phoenix.jpg Arclight Phoenix %}s in the graveyard & durdling around until you have enough lands for it to be possible to cast three spells in a turn.

Interacting with the opponent & trading resources with them is usually good since you have a lot of card draw / card advantage.

If you can, it is of course great to use the {% unicard {static}/media/phoenix-sideboard/mid-224-galvanic-iteration.jpg Galvanic Iteration %} on something expensive like {% unicard {static}/media/phoenix-sideboard/ktk-59-treasure-cruise.jpg Treasure Cruise %} rather than a mere {% unicard {static}/media/phoenix-sideboard/sta-19-opt.jpg Opt %}, but using it on a small spell is still fine.

## The Core Mechanic

{% unicard {static}/media/phoenix-sideboard/grn-91-arclight-phoenix.jpg Arclight Phoenix %} reads:
```txt
At the beginning of combat on your turn,
if you’ve cast three or more instant and sorcery spells this turn,
return Arclight Phoenix from your graveyard to the battlefield.
```

You want to look for opportunities to cast three instants or sorceries in your turn & before combat. Your opponent knows you are trying to do this.

The copy from galvanic iteration does not count as "casting" a spell, plan accordingly.

## How to be Good at Magic™

Make the most of your mana ever turn cycle (turn **cycle** specifically. often the best time to act is in the opponent's end step, since that is the last opportunity to do stuff before your lands untap → it is the last opportunity to use mana from untapped lands)

Know what your opponent is trying to do, what the critical turn is likely to be, whether they appear to be spending resources on trying to find lands to make their land drops vs whether they are advancing their gameplan, etc. If they are struggling to just find their lands, be aggressive; they probably can't counter your spell.

Failing that, do things that make the opponent play worse. Force them to make a lot of choices, so they have more opportunities to make the wrong ones. Winning is made out of scads of tiny edges and correct decisions made out of habit & reflex. People make a lot of mistakes.

Think in terms of how many turns you are away from killing the opponent (your "clock") and how different lines of play change or don't change your clock. If using a burn spell on the opponent isn't going to make them die any faster (e.g. it means they are at 1 rather than at 3) this usually means "don't use it on them; just wait". You want to **preserve optionality**

## Sideboarding

If killing their creatures doesn't put you ahead then you probably don't need things that kill their creatures.

Kill their {% unicard /media/phoenix-sideboard/thals.png https://scryfall.com/card/dka/24/thalia-guardian-of-thraben Thalia, Guardian of Thraben %} on sight.

They're going to try to exile the {% unicard {static}/media/phoenix-sideboard/grn-91-arclight-phoenix.jpg Arclight Phoenix %} in the post-sideboard games; consider not putting them in the graveyard unless you plan on reviving them very soon.

### Specific matchups

Not going to give exact numbers for how many copies to take out; go based on vibes. If you're on the draw then you expect to be on the defensive so keep in more of the cheap and interactive stuff to try to resist their early aggression

#### Green Devotion
- Treasure Cruise
- Lightning Axe
- Pieces of the Puzzle
- Opt
+ Negate
+ Disdainful Stroke
+ **Aether Gust**
+ Mystical Dispute

#### Rakdos Midrange
**Save lightning axes for Sheoldred you have no other way of profitably killing it**
- Galvanic Iteration
- Pieces of the Puzzle
- Opt
- Treasure Cruise
+ **Young Pyromancer**
+ Negate
+ Abrade
+ Crackling Drake
+ Brotherhood's End

#### White Humans / Weenies
Bring in removal, especially boardwipes
Take out spell pierces and trim some copies of more expensive spells
This matchup is about surviving the first few turns

#### Generic Control
Take out burn spells such as spikefield hazard & fiery impulse
Bring in counterspells and things that generate value e.g. crackling drake & young pyromancer

#### Generic Aggro
Take out expensive spells that you won't have time to cast before dying. Feel free to take out one of each of a few things.
Bring in all the removal: burn spells, boardwipes. Remember that if your third noncreature spell is Brotherhood's End, you could wipe their board and then get all your Phoenixes back

#### Generic Combo
Burn spells out
Counterspells in

#### Convoke / Loxodon Hierarch Aggro
Burn and boardwipes in
Spell pierce out

## Notes

At this point it's 5pm and the event is at 6:45 so I'm out of writing time. I'll add more specifics before next week's event.
