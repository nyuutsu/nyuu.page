My dear partner Alyssa[ref]she can be found online in many places including her [blog] and [twitter][/ref] has encouraged me to have more of an online presence. I think she would enjoy having less of a "mysterious entity" for a boyfriend & instead have more of a "knowable person that exists". So, I'm going to try blogging my way to legibility.

So: I look forward to meeting lots of people and adding features to this site. And, maybe, I'll share some interesting thoughts, too. I have a reasonably deep stable of topics I'd like to talk about; I'm going to make an attempt to finish and post something daily for at least the next week or so.

<!-- more -->

I mention *features*: this website is generated by Pelican. There are a handful of features (related to archiving external content & displaying on-hover information about Magic cards) that I expect I'll want; I look forward to writing (and writing about) them.

I'll turn on comments (via [Isso]) and syndication in a day or so. In the meantime if you'd like to say hello: I can be found on [my twitter], and on discord as `nyuu#5711`.
